## Summary

This proposal intends to limit the voting period for HIPs to the first seven days of every month.  This is to allow voters a easier time in knowing when votes will take place to increase voter turnout. This will also increase knowledge of what is going on in the network by allowing people to easily monitor what HIPs passed and failed by checking once a month instead of having to keep a constant eye on the network.

## Motivation

The goal of this HIP is to increase participation in governance and general knowledge of governance activities. This would be done by limiting the voting period of HIPs to the first seven days of every month. This means that veTOKEN holders would always know when they would need to vote and would not need to pay attention to discord or app notifications to know when to vote. It also means all network participants would be able to check what proposals passed and what could potentially affect them once per month instead of needing to pay attention to other sources. It also results in veTOKEN holders not missing votes due to missing notifications of the vote due to it being the same time every month.

## Stakeholders

Directly all veTOKEN holders would be affected. Indirectly all stakeholders of the network would be affected due to the change in how changes are made to the network.

## Detailed Explanation

This HIP would limit the Helium Foundation from signing new proposals to the first of every month. This could potentially be set to a specific time such as midnight UTC

## Drawbacks

The biggest concern for this HIP is that it makes it slower to react to new problems that may need to be solved in a quick manner. A emergency HIP that is not ready on the 1st of the month, will need to wait for another to be voted on. One solution might be for the Helium Foundation to have the ability to start votes outside of the designated timeframe when they think it is appropriate.

## Rationale and Alternatives

Another solution would be announcing HIP votes much more significantly in advance to make sure all parties know about the vote and when it is taking place. This could reasonably result in the same advantages as the current proposal but results in HIPs taking even longer to be voted on. For example if a HIP is finished near the end of a month, then we would need to wait several weeks after announcing the voting period to start the vote instead of simply just voting on it whenever the next first of the month comes around. In the inverse if the waiting period is shorter then a month a HIP finished near the beginning of a month may be able to be voted on faster then this proposal. Generally though I would advise that the waiting period should also be a month to make sure participants in the network do not need to pay additional attention to voting matters. If the waiting period is the same length, then no matter what this proposal results in the same amount of time or less before a vote can take place on a proposal.

## Unresolved Questions

The biggest unresolved question is the timeframe for when voting occurs and how often. This could easily be every quarter or every year instead of every month. The question is how slow is too slow for the improvement of the network. I personally think once a month at a set time is likely the best option but discussion with community members should probably take place before this is merged.

Should this be done by precedent or be done by a actual change to the modular-governance repo?

Should the specific time of day also be set in this HIP, or is any time on the first on the month a reasonable time?

## Success Metrics

This HIP will be considered successful if more veMOBILE tokens are voting under this new system and if more participants choose to vote in future HIPs
